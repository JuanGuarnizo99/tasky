# Tasky
A simple and intuitive todo list application designed to help you stay organized and manage your tasks effectively. With Tasky, you can create, track, and organize your daily tasks effortlessly. 
## Technologies used
The main framework used to create this frontend application was React.  
I also used a bit of css to style the components but most of the code is React.  
To use this app just go to https://tasky-app.onrender.com and sign up.  
I also wrote the code for the backend application.  
You can have a look at the backend repo at https://github.com/JuanGuarnizo99/tasky-api
## Contributing
This was my first personal project and I did it all on my own. Nonetheless feel free to make pull requests or give advice on features that could be added in the future.
